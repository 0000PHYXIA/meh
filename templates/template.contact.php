<h3 class="normal">Question #1: Can I be a moderator?</h3>
<span class="link normal">+</span>
<div class="panel">
<p>Moderator work is time consuming and can sometimes seem thankless. It is not always easy and not always fun. You will make new friends but may also lose some. From time to time you will be called upon to make hard decisions - even some you may personally disagree with. That said, it can also be your most rewarding experience on Augoeides. </p>
<br />
<p>
Moderator status is gained by invitation. Do not ever ASK for it.

<h3 class="normal">Question #2: How can I become an ambassador?</h3>
<span class="link normal">+</span>
<div class="panel">
<p>The Ambassadors is the branch of the volunteer program that helps with player support. They specialize in helping players, new and old with any questions or problems they may have. One of their duties is to personally greet new players, giving them a good start in the game as well as welcoming them to Augoeides. They also maintain a presence in the help channels providing moderation, support and answering questions where required.</p><br />
<p>Always check our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HiddenServer/452128178201915" target="_blank">facebook fan page</a> and see if we are still looking for any ambassadors. Ambassadors are basically old players who have played the game for a very long time and know how the game works. Don't apply if you're still new. Also - if you don't get a reply from Administrators within 24 hours, I'm dearly sorry but you weren't chosen.</p>

<h3 class="normal">Question #3: Can I have free ACs or Membership?</h3>
<span class="link normal">+</span>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. Simply because we need money to pay off the VPS hosting provider. On the bright side, the server randomly hands out 500 ACs to one lucky winner every thirty minutes. We might also hand out 5,000 ACs to all players who helped us test the game.</p>

<h3 class="normal">Question #4: My account is hacked / stolen / lost! What do I do!?</h3>
<span class="link normal">+</span>
<div class="panel">
<p>Most accounts that are 'Hacked' are not truly 'hacked.' An account is stolen because a player has given their password out to a 'friend,' who then takes advantage of that information. Players do this because the 'friend' has promised them in-game items, gold or AdventureCoins and no one can give you these things in-game. We have no control over what information you give to another player, but YOU DO. Remember, we do not allow players to share, trade, sell or give away accounts.</p>
<br />
<p>Go to <a href="/contact/recover">this page</a> and fill the required fields. We will send you your new password via e-mail. If you do not remember your e-mail address you used for your account, we are sorry to inform you that we can't retrieve your account no matter what. You cannot get an account back in-game or via our in-game reporting system.</p>

<h3 class="normal">Question #5: When do you guys release new content?</h3>
<span class="link normal">+</span>
<div class="panel">
<p>Mostly on the weekends so anywhere from Friday to Sunday. And please don't complain if there's no new content - Staff members also have a life to deal with.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3 class="normal">Question #6: Am I allowed to share, trade, sell or give away my account?</h3>
<span class="link normal">+</span>
<div class="panel">
<p>We do not allow people to share, trade, sell or give away accounts. This is a direct violation of our Rules and Terms & Conditions. People most often are "hacked" because they share an account with a friend. If you share your account with someone, it means that you have to share your account user name and your password and this significantly lessens the safety and security of your account.</p><br />
<p>We also do not allow players to share game account verifications. If we see that you are sharing accounts and/or verifications, all of your associated game accounts could be banned/disabled.</p><br />
<p>You should NEVER share your password with anyone. If you think that someone may know your password, you should change it immediately. Please visit this help page to learn how to change your password.</p><br />
<p>Staff Members will never ask for your password. They do not need your password to assist you. If someone is asking for your password, they are not a staff member and are most likely trying to scam you. </p>
